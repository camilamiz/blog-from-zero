# Blog-from-zero

## Description
This challenge is part of Rocketseat's (@rocketseat-education) ReactJS RoadMap. In this exercise, we are given a template with a very basic project structure, from which we will build a blog with a home page and specific pages for each post. In this blog, there should be the following features:
#### In the home page:
* We should be able to create posts using a CMS (Content Management System);
* There should be a link in the end of the page which says "more posts", where we will use pagination;

#### In the post page:
* In the end of the page, there should be a "previous post" link and a "next post" link. When they are not available, it must not show anything;
* There should be a comments section by the end of the page;

In both pages (home and post), we should be able to see draft posts when in preview mode.

## Used tecnologies
* Next.js
* React
* Prismic CMS
* Utteranc.es

## How to run
1. First, we have to clone this project by running in a terminal window the command below:
<pre>$ git clone git@github.com:camilamiz/chakra-ui-interface.git</pre>

2. Access the cloned repository with:
<pre>$ cd chakra-ui-interface</pre>

3. Install the dependencies by running:
<pre>$ yarn</pre>

4. Start the aplication
<pre>$ yarn start</pre>

Now you can access the application by accessing in your browser the address https://localhost:3000
